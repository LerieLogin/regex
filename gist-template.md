# Regex

Regular expressions (regex) are a versatile tool for working with text. They let you search, match, and manipulate strings using different types patterns. Whether you're validating input, searching through logs, or extracting data, regex can make something complex much simpler with just a few characters.

## Summary

This guide will introduce you to regular expressions (regex), a handy tool for manipulating text patterns. We'll cover key concepts like:

- Anchors to pinpoint positions in your text.

- Quantifiers to specify how many times something should be matched.

- nGrouping Constructs for handling multiple patterns together.

- Bracket Expressions for defining sets of characters.

- Character Classes for common matches like digits or letters.

- The OR Operator for choosing between alternatives.

- Flags to tweak regex behavior, like making it case-insensitive.

- Character Escapes for special characters and symbols.

- Youâ€™ll get practical examples to help you understand how to use these elements effectively.

Example regex pattern:

```^(\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4})$```

## Regex Components

### Anchors
    - Anchors are good when you need to be specific about a characters position in a string.

### Quantifiers
    - Quantifiers specify the number of times a character or group should be matched.

### Grouping Constructs
    - Goruping constructs help you group sections of a regex patter together as well as apply quantifiers to the group.


### Bracket Expressions
    - Bracket expressions are used to define a set of characters to match.

### Character Classes
    - Character classes define predefined sets of characters

### The OR Operator
    - Th OR operator lets you match (just an alternative)

### Flags
    - Flags change how the regex engine works

### Character Escapes
    - Character escapes match special characters
